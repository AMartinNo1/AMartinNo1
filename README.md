# Welcome 

Hi, I am an aviation enthusiast and software developer. Most of the time I work with [TYPO3](https://github.com/TYPO3/TYPO3.CMS/) at [Constructiva Solutions GmbH](https://www.constructiva.de/).

In my free time I blog semi actively on [frankfurtflyer.de](https://www.frankfurtflyer.de/) which is a german aviation blog and here and there work on tools primary as hobby with a neat side effect to help others. See [Great Circle Mapper - Made in Germany](https://gcmap.de/en) for example. Compared to similar tools it does not track you nor contains advertisement.
